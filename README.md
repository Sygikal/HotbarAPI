# HotbarAPI

Adds tons of hotbar-related things:
- Data driven registration of Status Bars (with java code needed for logic (and rendering if you wish))
- Data driven registration of Status Bar Overlays (for use with mods like appleskin)
- Data driven highlights for hotbar slots (based on slot index or specific item. interacted through commands)
